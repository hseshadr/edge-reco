"""Re-sign the committed ``examples/catalog`` bundle from its own contents.

Materializes the current signed bundle into a staging dir, drops in the current
``DEFAULT_RANKING_CONFIG`` (so a config retune — e.g. Phase-2's strategy map, Phase-3's
co-occurrence strategies — flows into the seed bundle) plus the seed ``cooccurrence.json``
computed from the committed demo session log, and republishes.

Product images follow ``EDGERECO_IMAGE_MODE`` — ONE switch, two supported modes:

``local`` (default)
    Every product's REAL photo is downloaded here, once, validated
    (``edgereco.catalog.image_download``), written to ``frontend/app/public/images/``
    and pointed at by a root-relative ``image_url``. A page load then makes ZERO
    third-party requests, so the deployed CSP stays ``img-src 'self' data:``. A photo
    that fails to download falls back to that product's generated SVG card
    (``edgereco.catalog.product_image``) — per product, never per build.

``remote``
    The catalog's own CDN urls are restored and no images are staged. The deployment
    must then list those hosts in ``img-src`` (``frontend/app/scripts/imageCsp.mjs``
    does this at build time) AND ship them to the component allowlist, or every card
    renders as a placeholder. Cheaper to build; every visitor's IP reaches that CDN.

Photo BYTES are deliberately kept out of the signed bundle: ``syncIndex`` reassembles
and hash-verifies every manifest file on each sync, so signing ~16 MB of photos would
push them onto every visitor for bytes no client reads back. They are an origin asset.

The prebuilt ``vector/`` is carried verbatim (embeddings depend on text, not on
``image_url``), so the FAISS index stays byte-identical.

Every rebuild publishes at a STRICTLY GREATER ``sequence`` — a changed bundle at an
unchanged sequence is what a client refuses as a rollback, permanently bricking it.

Run from backend/ (regenerate the demo sessions first if they changed)::

    .venv/bin/python3 scripts/gen_demo_sessions.py
    .venv/bin/python3 scripts/rebuild_example_bundle.py

Then mirror the result into the browser parity fixture (the browser syncs this copy)::

    rm -rf ../frontend/packages/edgeproc-browser/src/engine/__fixtures__/bundle/catalog
    cp -R examples/catalog \
        ../frontend/packages/edgeproc-browser/src/engine/__fixtures__/bundle/catalog
