"""Vector index — now backed by EdgeProc's FaissVectorIndex (the shared lego).

edge-reco's historical API is synchronous and returns inner-product *similarity*
(higher = nearer). EdgeProc's ``FaissVectorIndex`` is async and returns cosine
*distance* (lower = nearer). This thin adapter bridges both: it runs the async
calls to completion (every edge-reco call site is synchronous) and converts
distance back to similarity, so behavior is identical to the previous in-house
index while the FAISS work is owned by EdgeProc.

On disk, ``vector/`` is EdgeReco's SIGNED BUNDLE format, not edge-proc's persistence
format: exactly ``index.faiss`` + ``state.json`` + ``embeddings.f32``, flat and
deterministic. edge-proc >=0.4.1 persists to crash-atomic ``snapshots/`` generations
(random names, a lock file) and migrates a writable legacy pair into them on load,
deleting the pair. The browser tier reads ``vector/state.json`` and a retrain copies
the synced ``vector/`` verbatim into the next bundle, so this adapter writes the flat
layout itself and loads it from a private copy, never touching the source directory.
