"""Item-to-item co-occurrence: the "customers who bought X also bought Y" math.

A pure, deterministic data transform. From a set of sessions — each a list of
``(product_id, event_type)`` interactions — it builds a sparse top-N neighbour map
per product. Each interaction contributes its retrain ``ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHTS`` (cart 4,
favorite 3, click 1, view 0.2) to that product's per-session engagement; a product's
engagement vector indexes sessions. Neighbour scores are the **cosine similarity**
between two products' engagement vectors:

    score(a, b) = Σ_s w_a(s)·w_b(s) / ( ‖w_a‖ · ‖w_b‖ )

so two products that are co-engaged with similar intensity across the same sessions
rank highest, self is excluded, pairs are symmetric, and only the top-N neighbours
are kept. Cosine (over Jaccard) so high-intent baskets weigh more than passive views.

Carried in the signed bundle as ``cooccurrence.json`` and recomputed by retrain.
Mirrored in the browser tier — keep the normalisation (cosine), the ``ENGAGEMENT_WEIGHTS``,
and the top-N cut in sync.
