"""Ranking configuration: the scoring weights, carried in the signed bundle.

The scorer used to hardcode its weights as module constants. They now live in a
typed ``RankingConfig`` serialized as ``ranking_config.json`` inside the signed,
content-addressed bundle, so a maintainer can retune ranking by republishing data
— no code change, no redeploy. ``DEFAULT_RANKING_CONFIG`` reproduces the original
constants byte-for-byte and is the typed fallback when a bundle predates the file,
so today's scores stay identical.
