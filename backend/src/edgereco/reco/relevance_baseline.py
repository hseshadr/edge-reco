"""The relevance seam: EdgeReco's committed ranking export scored by Assay's
ranking face, which wraps ``ir_measures``/``trec_eval`` — the IR field's reference
implementation.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
The engine's parity tests prove the browser reproduces the server. They cannot tell
you both are wrong. ``relevance_export.json`` (written by the frontend suite) records
what the engine actually returned for the 50 golden queries; this module turns that
record into precision/recall/nDCG/MRR/MAP so a threshold can be asserted against it.

WHY THE METRIC IS PYTHON'S
One rule in two languages will diverge. The TypeScript suite owns *producing* the
ranked lists; this module owns *scoring* them, and the numbers it produces are the
ones CI gates on. The arithmetic is not ours at all — it is trec_eval's, reached
through ``assay.ranking``. Nothing here reimplements a metric.

THE SEAM RULE (inject, don't entangle)
``assay`` is imported HERE and nowhere else in edgereco's relevance path. Upgrading,
renaming or swapping the metrics engine touches this one file.

NEVER AVERAGE ACROSS SEGMENTS
``natural`` queries are worded from text held out of both retrieval representations;
``taxonomy-word`` queries are the label field itself (the leaky control group); and
``negative`` queries have no answer in the catalog. A mean over the three is a number
about nothing. Callers ask for one segment at a time — this module has no "overall".
