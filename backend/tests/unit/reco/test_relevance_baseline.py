"""The relevance ratchet: EdgeReco's ranking quality may improve, never regress.

WHAT THIS GATES
Every floor below is TODAY'S MEASURED NUMBER, not a target. The gate passes on the
unmodified ranker by construction — a threshold chosen after a ranking fix measures
nothing, because you can always pick one the new code clears. Pinned at the baseline,
the gate answers exactly one question: did this change make relevance worse?

WHERE THE NUMBERS CAME FROM
``assay.ranking`` (ir_measures/trec_eval) over the committed
``relevance_export.json``, re-measured 2026-08-03 after the absolute relevance floor
landed, at the export's own depth k=24 and at the conventional first-page depth k=10.

WHY FLOORS ARE ROUNDED DOWN TO 4dp
0.539049 is asserted as 0.5390. trec_eval is deterministic and the export is a static
committed artifact, so the metric is exactly reproducible; the ~5e-5 of slack exists
only so a BLAS thread count cannot turn float noise into a red run. It is far tighter
than any regression worth catching — a single relevant document falling out of the
top 10 moves natural nDCG@10 by ~0.02, three orders of magnitude more.

RAISING A FLOOR IS THE POINT
When a ranking fix lands, its PR re-measures and raises these numbers. That is the
ratchet working. Lowering one is a regression being waved through, and needs to be
argued for in the PR that does it — never a quiet edit.
