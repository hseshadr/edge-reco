/**
 * Bundle-sync error classification — edge-reco's adoption of the portfolio
 * canonical-errors standard ([`@edgeproc/errors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@edgeproc/errors),
 * installed from npm).
 *
 * This module is the ONLY place in the app that names that library. Everything
 * else imports `bootErrorMessage` / `bundleErrorRegistry` from here, so
 * upgrading, swapping, or removing the library is a one-file change.
 *
 * The one user-facing failure the demo can actually hit is the one-time signed
 * catalog-bundle sync. The in-browser engine throws typed errors deep in that
 * pipeline — `NetworkError` (fetchBytes.ts), `IntegrityError` (integrity.ts),
 * `SignatureError` (crypto.ts), `WorkerTimeoutError` / `WorkerCrashError`
 * (workerFault.ts) — which propagate to App's boot `.catch`. A failure inside
 * the sync Worker arrives instead as `EngineOperationError`, whose category
 * survives only in its stable `.code` (integrity · rollback · network · lock ·
 * storage · internal); both shapes are classified here. This module is the
 * single place those raw failures are classified into stable canonical codes,
 * so a failure is loggable/greppable now and serializable to RFC 9457 Problem
 * Details later, in the shared portfolio vocabulary.
 *
 * Behaviour-identical: the BootScreen has always shown the engine's own message
 * verbatim, so `bootErrorMessage` preserves that exact string — no user-visible
 * copy and no i18n keys change. Only the classification vocabulary (and a
 * dev-facing coded console breadcrumb) is new.
