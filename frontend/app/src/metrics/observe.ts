// Live observers that feed the metrics store from real browser signals:
//   - PerformanceObserver on "resource" entries -> count POST-READY backend calls
//     (edge/other), excluding 3rd-party product images and the optional uplink
//     beacon. In the normal backend-free demo this stays 0 after sync.
//   - The Worker network sentinel -> the SAME count, over the traffic of every
//     Worker the engine owns. A Worker keeps its own resource-timing timeline,
//     so the observer above is blind to it: without this the counter would keep
//     reading 0 while a request left the browser from inside the pipeline. Each
//     Worker publishes its own view; entries arrive on the shared epoch clock
//     and are rebased onto this context's timeline before they are counted.
//   - A ~1s memory poll -> main-thread JS heap (Chromium-only via
//     performance.memory). Left null on non-Chromium — never fabricated.
//
// All wiring is guarded so unsupported browsers (no PerformanceObserver, no
// BroadcastChannel, no performance.memory) degrade silently rather than throw.
