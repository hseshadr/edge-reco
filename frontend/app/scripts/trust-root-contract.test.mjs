/**
 * ONE trust root, read ONE way.
 *
 * The pinned trust root ships in three committed copies: the one the SPA serves
 * (`frontend/app/public/public.key`), the publisher's (`backend/examples/keys/`),
 * and the browser package's self-contained test fixture. The sync Worker reads
 * the served copy with `@edgeproc/browser`'s `loadTrustRoot` → `parseTrustRoot`
 * (a raw 32-byte Ed25519 key OR an `edgeproc.keyring/v1` JSON keyring), and the
 * ranking-proof check reads it with the same `parseTrustRoot`.
 *
 * So a key change can't leave the copies disagreeing (the app would pin one key
 * while the publisher signs with another) or leave a trust root that the
 * shared parser rejects (every visitor's sync would refuse). Rotate by editing
 * all three together — ideally to a keyring, never by silently swapping bytes.
