/**
 * Node-version preflight for the canonical gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * This repo carried TWO Node pins that disagreed, in the worst possible
 * direction: `.nvmrc` said 24 and `.node-version` said 22, `ci.yml` +
 * `security-audit.yml` hardcoded 24, and `deploy.yml` read `.node-version` — so
 * CI tested on Node 24 while the artifact shipped to edge-reco.com was BUILT on
 * Node 22. The deployed build ran on a runtime nothing tested against, and the
 * local gate enforced neither.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic difference. In a sibling repo this exact class of skew
 * reported three permanently-broken tests as green for an entire session: Node
 * 22's WebCrypto REJECTS the cross-realm bare `ArrayBuffer` that @noble/ed25519
 * passes to `subtle.digest` (as `m.buffer`), and Node 24 ACCEPTS it. Same
 * commit, same lockfile — the runtime alone flipped the result. This app depends
 * on @noble/ed25519 (it verifies the signed catalog bundle), so it is exposed to
 * the same behavioural difference.
 *
 * So this FAILS rather than warns. A warning is precisely what got ignored: it
 * scrolls past above several minutes of subsequent output and the gate still
 * exits 0, which is the only signal anyone reads.
 *
 * WHY EXACT MATCH, NOT `>=`
 *
 * A floor structurally cannot catch this. `engines.node: ">=22.12"` is already
 * satisfied by 24.16.0 — the bug WAS a behavioural change in a later major, so
 * any range that admits both runtimes admits the bug. `.nvmrc` pins one exact
 * build and `actions/setup-node` installs exactly that build, so "identical to
 * CI" is the only property worth asserting. Bumping Node is a deliberate act:
 * edit `frontend/.nvmrc`, and local, CI, and the deploy build move together.
 *
 * WHY .nvmrc IS THE ONLY PIN
 *
 * `.node-version` was deleted rather than kept in sync. Two files that must
 * agree are two files that can disagree; this one already had. Every consumer
 * now reads `frontend/.nvmrc`: `nvm use`, all three workflows, and this script.
