/**
 * `@edgeproc/errors` — the portfolio's canonical-errors library — is a SHARED
 * library consumed from npm, not a copy living in this repo.
 *
 * This repo used to carry a fork of it at `frontend/packages/edgeproc-errors/`.
 * A fork cannot be upgraded, so it silently rots: by the time it was removed it
 * was pinned at `0.1.0-dev` against a published `0.1.1`, sat 408 source lines
 * behind upstream, and was missing 8 exports the library had since grown
 * (`corePack`, `aiPack`, `bundlePack`, `defineErrorsWith`, `DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CODE`,
 * `UnregisteredFallbackError`, `KnownCategory`, `RegistryOptions`). Nothing was
 * red the whole time, because nothing was measuring it.
 *
 * These are the three ways that regression can come back, each checked directly:
 *
 *   1. the declared dependency reverts to a local protocol (`workspace:`, `link:`, ...)
 *   2. a fork of the library reappears under `frontend/packages/`
 *   3. the RESOLVED package is not the published artifact
 *
 * (3) is the one that matters most, and it is why this test reads
 * `node_modules` rather than stopping at `package.json`. A manifest declaring
 * `^0.1.1` proves only what we asked for; an override, a stale link, or a
 * re-introduced fork can still put something else on disk. The property is
 * "the published package is what the app actually loads", so that is what gets
 * asserted.
 *
 * `@edgeproc/browser` is deliberately NOT covered here: it is a first-party
 * package that belongs to this repo and is meant to live under
 * `frontend/packages/`. Only the shared, separately-published library is
 * constrained.
