/**
 * The COLD / BLOCKED-CDN boot proof (house standard §8.1b), on the MINIFIED
 * production build with the REAL generated service worker — the aml-filter
 * screen-cold-blocked mechanism, adapted to the storefront.
 *
 * With every HuggingFace host AND jsDelivr aborted, the full shopper journey
 * still works: launch → real ~23 MB MiniLM loads from the same-origin /models/
 * mirror → store mounts → a real search re-ranks the grid. This proves the
 * runtime has ZERO CDN dependency (weights self-hosted by
 * scripts/download-model.mjs; the ONNX-runtime WASM emitted same-origin into
 * dist/assets by the Vite build).
 *
 * It doubles as the `useBrowserCache` + `build.target: "es2022"` guard: the
 * zero-console-errors assertion on the MINIFIED build re-trips if the es2020
 * private-field downlevel crash (`Ke(...).call is not a function` — aml-filter's
 * scar) ever returns, and the transformers-cache assertion proves the re-enabled
 * CacheStorage path actually ran.
