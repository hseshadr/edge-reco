// The relevance golden set: 50 queries with hand-written intents and ground-truth
// relevant sets that are derived WITHOUT consulting the ranker.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// The engine has parity tests (does the browser reproduce the server?) but no
// relevance test (does either one return the right products?). Parity can be
// perfect while both tiers are wrong. This file is the missing half: an
// independent statement of what SHOULD come back, so precision/recall/nDCG/MRR
// can be measured and a later ranking fix can be shown to have improved them.
//
// THE LABEL RULE (one rule, applied to every query)
//   relevant(q) = { p : some node of p's Amazon breadcrumb path is a named node }
// where a product's breadcrumb path is `[category, ...subcategories]` — the tuple
// `catalog/preprocessor.py::_split_breadcrumbs` splits out of the source CSV's
// `breadcrumbs` column, long before any tokenizer, embedder or scorer runs.
//
// WHY THE LABELS ARE INDEPENDENT OF WHAT THEY MEASURE
//   1. The labels are authored upstream (Amazon's own breadcrumbs), not by us and
//      not by the engine. Building them reads products.jsonl and nothing else — no
//      embedding, no BM25 score, no engine call. A golden set derived from the
//      embeddings would always pass; this one cannot be satisfied by construction.
//   2. Query wording is drawn from `description` and `title`, never from the
//      taxonomy. `description` is in NEITHER retrieval representation — not the
//      BM25 corpus (`keyword.ts::productTokens` = title + category + tags + brand)
//      and not the embedded text (`embeddings/encoder.py::_product_text`, the same
//      four fields). Every `natural` query carries a "held-out anchor": a word that
//      is common in the relevant products' descriptions and absent from their
//      taxonomy fields, so the query has a hook the retriever literally cannot see.
//   3. The leak is measured, not assumed away. `category` and `tags` ARE inside both
//      retrieval representations, so a query made of taxonomy words matches the
//      label field directly. Those queries are segmented as `taxonomy-word` and
//      reported separately; mixing them with `natural` would hide the leak.
//
// THE RESIDUAL LEAK, STATED HONESTLY
// `tags` are slugified `subcategories` ("Garden Hoses" -> "garden-hoses"), so they
// are a restatement of the label, not a second signal. BM25 tokenizes on whitespace
// (`keyword.ts::tokenize`), so a multi-word tag is ONE token and a natural query
// cannot hit it — that is the property `taxonomyCorpusTokens` guards. The sentence
// -transformer tokenizer does split on hyphens, so subcategory words do reach the
// VECTOR side even for `natural` queries. The natural segment's scores are
// therefore an upper bound on true generalization, not a clean measurement.
//
// SEGMENTS
//   natural       — a shopping phrase a person would type; no query word is a BM25
//                   token of any relevant product's category/tags.
//   taxonomy-word — the query IS a breadcrumb label; every relevant product shares
//                   a BM25 taxonomy token with it. The leaky control group.
//   negative      — no product in the catalog answers the query, so the correct
//                   relevant set is EMPTY. Half gibberish, half plausible-but-absent
//                   product types. These are what expose a missing score floor: an
//                   engine with no notion of "no good match" still returns k results.
