// @edgereco/browser — EdgeReco's in-browser recommendation engine.
//
// The generic signed-bundle sync, OPFS, Worker and integrity substrate comes
// from the standalone @edgeproc/browser dependency. This package owns only the
// EdgeReco domain layer: embeddings, hybrid search, ranking and session state.
//
// Primary entry point: EngineRuntime.bootstrap() → SearchEngine.
//
// The node-only fixture loader lives behind
// `@edgereco/browser/testing/fixtures`. Generic test seams are imported
// directly from `@edgeproc/browser`.

// --- the SyncResult shape leaks through BootStage; expose its type only ---
export type { SyncResult } from "@edgeproc/browser";
// --- the engine-owned domain contract (single source of truth) ---

	BrowseResponse,
	EventType,
	InteractionEvent,
	Product,
	RecommendResponse,
	ScoreComponents,
	SearchResponse,
	SearchResult,
} from "./engine/domain";
// --- the embedder seam (transformers.js in production, stubbable in tests) ---
// EMBEDDING_MODEL stays engine-internal: the model id is wired inside
// createEmbedder; consumers only ever need the dimension.
export { EMBEDDING_DIM, type Embedder } from "./engine/embedder";
// --- the bundle-carried ranking config: strategy map + weights ---
// DEFAULT_RANKING_CONFIG stays engine-internal: the runtime reads the config
// from the signed bundle; only the TYPES are part of the public surface.
