// Session-aware reranker, ported from edge-reco's reco/scorer.py + reco/reranker.py.
// scoreProduct produces a live Assay explanation; rerank re-scores a result set
// and sorts it descending. The weights and ordered formula match scorer.py exactly:
//
//   retrieval + w_popularity*popularity + w_category*category_match
//   + w_tag*tag_match + w_brand*brand_match + w_freshness*freshness
//   + w_similarity*similarity + w_cooccurrence*cooccurrence
//   - w_repetition*was_recently_viewed
//
// tag_match is the MEAN tag affinity over the product's tags (0 if it has none).
// Retrieval is normalized RRF for search and zero for recommendation-only rails.
