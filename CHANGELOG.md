# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

The Nimbus demo goes **backend-free**: the SPA syncs the signed bundle and runs
the full hybrid-search + session-aware-rerank pipeline in the browser tab. No
application backend in the request path. The in-browser engine is extracted as
a reusable workspace package, and the demo gains its own frontend CI.

### Added
- `@edgeproc/browser` — new private npm workspace package
  (`demo/packages/edgeproc-browser/`). In-browser signed-bundle sync into OPFS
  (ed25519 + sha256 fail-closed), reassembly, and the full hybrid-search engine
  (BM25 ⊕ vector → RRF → session rerank). Top-k parity-tested against the
  Python core over the same committed bundle.
- Browser embedder via transformers.js (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`,
  `{ pooling: "mean", normalize: true }`) — the byte-for-byte equivalent of the
  Python core's query encoder.
- Backend-free `docker compose up --build` path: `origin` → Caddy `edge` → static
  Nimbus SPA. No FastAPI in the request path; the browser does the search.
- Real 728-product Amazon catalog committed as the demo bundle
  (`examples/catalog/`), built via `edgereco build-catalog` → `index` → `bundle`.
- Frontend CI workflow: Biome lint + tsc + Vitest across the npm workspace plus
  Playwright end-to-end coverage of the backend-free hero loop (sync → search →
  click → rail re-rank → "why?" panel).

### Changed
- Top-level README + `CLAUDE.md` rewritten to make the backend-free demo the
  headline path; the Python FastAPI runtime is reframed as the optional
  server-side API variant.
- `@edgeproc/browser` public surface trimmed: low-level sync primitives
  (`MemoryCacheStore`, `syncIndex`, `materializeFile`, `Verify` / `FetchBytes`
  / `CacheStore`) moved behind the `./testing` subpath; the main entrypoint is
  the production runtime (`EngineRuntime`, `SearchEngine`, the domain types).
- Demo data layer (`demo/frontend/src/api/client.ts`) refactored from
  module-level mutable state to a `createDataClient(runtime)` factory.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-30

First public release. Python v1 reference architecture for edge-first product discovery.

### Added
- Manifest-based catalog sync with sha256 checksums (`edgereco sync`)
- BM25 keyword index (`rank-bm25`) and FAISS vector index (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion hybrid search (`edgereco search`, `GET /search`)
- Session-aware reranker: `0.40·pop + 0.20·cat + 0.15·tag + 0.10·brand + 0.10·fresh − 0.25·rep`
- Interaction event ingest (`POST /events`) with click / view / favorite / cart weights
- Recommendation endpoint with session signals (`GET /recommend`)
- Typer CLI: `sync`, `index`, `serve`, `search`, `preprocess`
- FastAPI app with Protocol-based DI for edge clients (HTTP + filesystem adapters)
- Synthetic 1000-product demo catalog (`scripts/generate_demo_catalog.py`)
- Docker Compose stack: origin + Caddy edge + app, with healthcheck-gated startup
- BDD test suite (5 Gherkin features), integration + e2e coverage, 98%+ line coverage
- GitHub Actions CI: ruff + mypy strict + pytest with 90% coverage gate
