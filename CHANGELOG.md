## [Unreleased]

Northstar hardening: full test pyramid wired into CI, modern dependencies, and a
discoverable config surface — so the repo is not just clear but provably works
end-to-end on a cold clone.

### Added
- **Playwright e2e in CI** (`.github/workflows/frontend.yml`): the storefront
  suite and the C1 sync suite now run on every push/PR, with HuggingFace model
  weights cached and traces uploaded on failure.
- **In-browser model-load smoke test** (`frontend/app/tests/e2e-c1/embed.spec.ts`
  + `embed-harness.html`): loads the real MiniLM model through onnxruntime-web
  WASM in headless Chromium and asserts a normalized 384-d embedding — guarding
  the browser ML path that unit tests (Node backend) can't cover.
- **`.env.example`** for both `backend/` and `frontend/`, documenting every env
  var the code reads, referenced from a new README "Configuration" section.
- Typed Pydantic response models for the API routes (`backend/.../api/models.py`).
- Backend `poe gate` task mirroring CI (lint + format-check + mypy + pytest-cov).

### Changed
- **Dependencies modernized.** Backend: mypy 1.20→2.1, polars 1.41,
  pydantic 2.13.4, sentence-transformers 5.5, typer 0.26, uvicorn 0.48, plus
  raised constraint floors. Frontend: transformers.js 3.8→4.2 (onnxruntime-web
  1.26-dev), jsdom 26→29; pinned Node via `engines` + `.nvmrc`.
- `@edgeproc/browser/testing` is now browser-safe; the node-only fixture loader
  moved behind `@edgeproc/browser/testing/fixtures` so importing the test-seam
  barrel never drags `node:fs` into a browser bundle.

### Fixed
- **Both Playwright suites were silently broken** since the `backend/`+`frontend/`
  restructure: `catalog-server.mjs` still resolved the signed catalog at the
  pre-restructure repo-root `examples/` instead of `backend/examples/`.
- Removed `@rolldown/binding-darwin-arm64` from direct deps (it is an optional
  per-platform binding) — `npm ci` on the Linux CI runner no longer fails.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

The Nimbus demo goes **backend-free**: the SPA syncs the signed bundle and runs
the full hybrid-search + session-aware-rerank pipeline in the browser tab. No
application backend in the request path. The in-browser engine is extracted as
a reusable workspace package, and the demo gains its own frontend CI.

### Added
- `@edgeproc/browser` — new private npm workspace package
  (`frontend/packages/edgeproc-browser/`). In-browser signed-bundle sync into OPFS
  (ed25519 + sha256 fail-closed), reassembly, and the full hybrid-search engine
  (BM25 ⊕ vector → RRF → session rerank). Top-k parity-tested against the
  Python core over the same committed bundle.
- Browser embedder via transformers.js (`Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`,
  `{ pooling: "mean", normalize: true }`) — the byte-for-byte equivalent of the
  Python core's query encoder.
- Backend-free `docker compose up --build` path: `origin` → Caddy `edge` → static
  Nimbus SPA. No FastAPI in the request path; the browser does the search.
- Real 728-product Amazon catalog committed as the demo bundle
  (`examples/catalog/`), built via `edgereco build-catalog` → `index` → `bundle`.
- Frontend CI workflow: Biome lint + tsc + Vitest across the npm workspace plus
  Playwright end-to-end coverage of the backend-free hero loop (sync → search →
  click → rail re-rank → "why?" panel).

### Changed
- Top-level README + `CLAUDE.md` rewritten to make the backend-free demo the
  headline path; the Python FastAPI runtime is reframed as the optional
  server-side API variant.
- `@edgeproc/browser` public surface trimmed: low-level sync primitives
  (`MemoryCacheStore`, `syncIndex`, `materializeFile`, `Verify` / `FetchBytes`
  / `CacheStore`) moved behind the `./testing` subpath; the main entrypoint is
  the production runtime (`EngineRuntime`, `SearchEngine`, the domain types).
- Demo data layer (`frontend/app/src/api/client.ts`) refactored from
  module-level mutable state to a `createDataClient(runtime)` factory.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-30

First public release. Python v1 reference architecture for edge-first product discovery.

### Added
- Manifest-based catalog sync with sha256 checksums
- BM25 keyword index (`rank-bm25`) and FAISS vector index (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), built via `edgereco index`
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion hybrid search (`edgereco search`, `GET /search`)
- Session-aware reranker: `0.40·pop + 0.20·cat + 0.15·tag + 0.10·brand + 0.10·fresh − 0.25·rep`
- Interaction event ingest (`POST /events`) with click / view / favorite / cart weights
- Recommendation endpoint with session signals (`GET /recommend`)
- Typer CLI: `index`, `serve`, `search`, `preprocess`
- FastAPI app with Protocol-based DI for edge clients (HTTP + filesystem adapters)
- Synthetic 1000-product demo catalog (superseded in 0.2.0 by the committed 728-product Amazon bundle built via `edgereco build-catalog`)
- Docker Compose stack: origin + Caddy edge + app, with healthcheck-gated startup
- BDD test suite (5 Gherkin features), integration + e2e coverage, 98%+ line coverage
- GitHub Actions CI: ruff + mypy strict + pytest with 90% coverage gate
